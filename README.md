# hello-world
Practicing the GitHub flow for the IMI programme. 
In 2015 i was studying IT at South West Gauteng Tvet College, i still remember at that time the programming language we learnt was Visual basic.Net. 
i unfortunately dropped out the following year due to some complications and since then i've been looking for an opportunity to finish what i had started.
